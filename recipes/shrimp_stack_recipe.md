# Spicy California Shrimp Stack
Easy stacks that satisfy your sushi craving with cucumber, avocado, shrimp and rice

## info  
* About 15 minutes  
* 4 servings  

## ingredients
* 1 1/3 cups cooked short-grain brown rice (from 1/2 cup uncooked)
* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 8 ounces cooked shrimp, peeled and tails removed
* 1 cup diced cucumber, about 1 small
* 1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives
* 1/2 cup mashed avocado, about 1 medium
* 4 teaspoons Furikake (such as Eden Shake or use sesame seeds)
* 4 teaspoons reduced-sodium soy sauce, or gluten-free
* 4 teaspoons mayonnaise
* 1 teaspoon sriracha sauce

## steps  
1. Cook rice according to package directions, omitting salt and oil. When rice is done, add rice vinegar and stir. Evenly spread rice on a sheet pan to cool.
2. Cut shrimp into 1-inch cubes. In a small bowl, combine cucumber and chives. In another small bowl, combine mayonnaise and sriracha sauce.
3. Using a 1 cup dry measuring cup, layer 1/4 cup cucumber, then 2 tablespoons of avocado, then 1/4 of the shrimp, and 1/3 cup rice.
4. Carefully turn the cup upside down to turn the stack out onto a plate, lightly tapping the bottom of the cup if necessary. Sprinkle with Furikake and drizzle with 1 teaspoon soy sauce and sriracha mayonnaise.
5. Repeat with remaining ingredients.

## notes  
* Use short grain sushi rice for sticky texture that's perfect for stacking
* Trader Joe's frozen brown rice is a great shortcut - takes 3 minutes to heat up
* Can substitute crab meat for more traditional California roll flavor
* Also works great with raw sushi grade salmon or tuna
* Buy shrimp frozen and defrost as needed for freshness
* If shrimp is raw, poach quickly in salted boiling water for 2-3 minutes until pink, then rinse under cold water
* Can make as bowls instead of stacks for easier preparation
* If you can't find Furikake, just use sesame seeds
