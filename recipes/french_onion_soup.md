A classic French soup featuring deeply caramelized onions in rich broth, topped with toasted bread and melted cheese.

## info
*   **Servings:** 4-6
*   **Cook Time:** 1.5-1.75 hours

## ingredients
### Soup Base
*   2 tbsp. (¼ stick) unsalted butter or duck fat
*   3 large onions (about 2.5 lb.), thinly sliced
*   1 large shallot, finely chopped
*   1 garlic clove, finely chopped
*   kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
*   ¼ cup dry white wine
*   ¼ cup pilsner beer
*   ½ tbsp. soy sauce
*   ¼ parmesan rind
*   ½ tbsp. white wine vinegar

### Aromatics
*   2 sprigs flat-leaf parsley
*   1 sprig thyme
*   1 bay leaf
*   4 cups low-sodium chicken, beef or vegetable broth (I use half and half beef and chicken broth)

### Topping
*   4 slices ¼"-thick slices country-style bread, toasted
*   4 ounces sliced comté cheese or gruyère

## steps
1.  (Optional, not traditional) Cook 2 chicken breasts, seasoned with salt and pepper, in oil until slightly browned. Remove and chop roughly before adding onions.
2.  Heat butter in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add onions, shallots, and garlic; season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and dark brown, 60–70 minutes. Add wine, beer, and vinegar. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes.
3.  Tie parsley, thyme, parmesan rind, and bay leaf with kitchen twine; add to pot along with broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 8 cups, 35–40 minutes. Add soy sauce, and pepper to taste; discard herb bundle.
4.  (Optional, not traditional) Add back chicken, 10 minutes before step 3 finishes.
5.  Preheat oven to 450°. Place ovenproof bowls on a large rimmed baking sheet. Divide soup among bowls and top with toasts (cut to fit if necessary) and cheese. Bake until cheese is bubbling and golden brown, 6–8 minutes.

## notes
*   Soup can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.
*   The key to this soup is patience - properly caramelizing the onions takes the full 60-70 minutes. Don't rush this step.
*   Gruyère is traditional, but comté, emmental, or even a good aged cheddar work well.
