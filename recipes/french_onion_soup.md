*   **Servings:** 4-6
*   **Prep Time:** 20 minutes
*   **Cook Time:** 75-85 minutes

## ingredients
### Soup Base
*   2 tbsp. (¼ stick) unsalted butter or duck fat
*   3 large onions (about 2.5 lb.), thinly sliced
*   1 large shallot, finely chopped
*   1 garlic clove, finely chopped
*   kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
*   ¼ cup dry vermouth or dry white wine
*   ½ tbsp. white wine vinegar

### Aromatics
*   2 sprigs flat-leaf parsley
*   1 sprig thyme
*   ½ bay leaf
*   4 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth

### Topping
*   4 slices ¼"-thick slices country-style bread, toasted
*   4 ounces sliced comté cheese or gruyère

## steps
1.  Heat butter in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add onions, shallots, and garlic; season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and dark brown, 60–70 minutes. Add vermouth and vinegar. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes.
2.  Tie parsley, thyme, and bay leaf with kitchen twine; add to pot along with broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 8 cups, 35–40 minutes; discard herb bundle.
3.  Preheat oven to 450°. Place ovenproof bowls on a large rimmed baking sheet. Divide soup among bowls and top with toasts (cut to fit if necessary) and cheese. Bake until cheese is bubbling and golden brown, 6–8 minutes.
4.  DO AHEAD: Soup can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.

## notes
*   The key to this soup is patience - properly caramelizing the onions takes the full 60-70 minutes. Don't rush this step.
*   If you don't have ovenproof bowls, you can broil the topped soup in regular bowls, watching carefully.
*   Gruyère is traditional, but comté, emmental, or even a good aged cheddar work well.
