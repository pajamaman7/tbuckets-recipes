## info

* 3 servings  

## ingredients

### Pan Fried Shrimp:
* 1 lb large shrimp, peeled and de-veined
* Generous pinch of salt
* 1 tbsp lime juice
* 2-3 tbsp oil for cooking

### Teriyaki Sauce:
* 2 tbsp water
* 2 tsp cornstarch (cornflour)
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 2 tbsp brown sugar or honey
* 1/4 cup mirin
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* Pinch of cayenne pepper (up to 1/4 tsp for spicy version)
* 1-2 tsp sesame oil
* 2 green onions, thinly sliced

### Sriracha Mayonnaise:
* 1/4 cup sriracha sauce
* 1/4 cup mayonnaise

### For the Rice Bowls:
* 3 cups cooked jasmine rice or any short grain rice
* 1 cup shredded carrots
* 2 avocados, sliced
* 3 green onions, thinly sliced
* 3 tbsp sushi ginger
* Sesame seeds
* 2 nori snack packets (found in Asian stores)

## steps  
1. **Pan Fried Shrimp:** Pat dry the shrimp to remove any moisture. Mix the shrimp with the salt and set aside.
2. Heat a large pan with 2-3 tbsp of oil on medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, pan fry the shrimp. Cook each side for about 2-3 minutes, until there's some caramelization on each side. Cook in two batches to avoid over-crowding the pan.
3. Toss the cooked shrimp with the fresh lime juice in a bowl. Keep in fridge until needed.
4. **Teriyaki Sauce:** Dissolve the cornstarch in the 2 tbsp of water and set aside.
5. Place all the sauce ingredients (except for the green onions and sesame oil), in a small pot or pan and heat over medium heat. Stir to dissolve the sugar, and bring it to a boil.
6. Add the cornstarch slurry and stir to thicken the sauce. Remove from heat as soon as the sauce thickens to desired consistency. Stir in the sesame oil. If too thick, add extra water to thin it out.
7. **Make Teriyaki Shrimp:** Place the cooked shrimp in a bowl. Pour in the teriyaki sauce and add the green onions. Toss to combine.
8. **Sriracha Mayonnaise:** Mix the sriracha and mayonnaise together until well mixed. Keep refrigerated until needed.
9. **Assemble Rice Bowls:** Divide the jasmine rice between 3 bowls. Top the rice with shredded carrots, avocado and nori sheets.
10. Divide the teriyaki shrimp between the 3 bowls. Sprinkle the green onions and sesame seeds on top, followed by a drizzle of sriracha mayonnaise. Serve.

## notes  
* Teriyaki sauce can be made ahead and stored in fridge for 1 week
* Pan fried shrimp can be portioned and stored in fridge for up to 3 days or frozen longer
* The sauce is not too sweet with just the right amount of tang and bite - adjust to taste
* Skip cayenne pepper for classic teriyaki flavor
* Perfect for meal prep - divide rice and shrimp into containers, store veggies separately
* Can substitute with extra firm tofu or leftover cooked chicken, pork, or beef
* Use any veggies you like - raw carrots, salad leaves, bean sprouts, edamame, shredded cabbage, snow peas, mushrooms
* Pickled vegetables pair great: pickled ginger, radish, carrots, beetroot, or kimchi
* Avocado adds perfect creaminess to balance the flavors
