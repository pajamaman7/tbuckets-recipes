# Beef and Broccoli
Easy 1-pan, 30-minute meal with tender beef and the best stir-fry sauce

## info  
* About 30 minutes  
* 4 servings  

## ingredients
### Beef and Broccoli:
* 1 lb flank steak, very thinly sliced into bite-sized strips
* 2 Tbsp olive oil (or vegetable oil), divided
* 1 lb fresh broccoli (cut into 6 cups of florets)
* 2 tsp sesame seeds, optional garnish

### Stir Fry Sauce:
* 1 tsp fresh ginger, grated (loosely packed)
* 2 tsp garlic, grated (from 3 cloves)
* 1/2 cup hot water
* 6 Tbsp low sodium soy sauce (or GF Tamari)
* 3 Tbsp packed light brown sugar
* 1 1/2 Tbsp corn starch
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 2 Tbsp sesame oil

## steps  
1. Prep: Start cooking white rice first so it's ready when the stir fry is done. Cover and freeze steak 30 minutes for easier slicing, then thinly slice against the grain.
2. Make the Sauce: Combine all stir fry sauce ingredients in a bowl, stir well to dissolve the sugar, and set aside.
3. Cook Broccoli: Place a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 Tbsp oil. Add broccoli florets and sauté 4-5 minutes, partially covered with lid, stirring or tossing several times until broccoli is bright green and crisp-tender then remove from pan. Tip: If you prefer softer broccoli, add 2 Tbsp water before covering with the lid and it will steam cook the broccoli.
4. Cook Beef: Increase heat to high heat and add 1 Tbsp oil. Add beef in a single layer and sauté 2 minutes per side or just until cooked through. Quickly pull out a piece to test for doneness.
5. Add the sauce, reduce heat to medium/low and simmer 3-4 minutes. It will thicken. Add broccoli and stir to combine. Stir in 1-2 Tbsp water to thin the sauce if desired. Serve over white rice.

## notes  
* Flank steak is best for stir fry - other options include Top Sirloin, Top Round, or Tri-Tip Steak
* Freeze steak for 30 minutes before slicing for easier, thinner cuts
* Slice against the grain, between 1/8" to 1/4" thick for tender results  
* Use fresh broccoli, not frozen, for best texture
* Don't overcrowd the pan or beef will steam instead of sear
* Use low sodium soy sauce and don't skip the sesame oil for authentic flavor
* Can substitute or add snap peas, bell peppers, carrots, or mushrooms
* Reheats well for meal prep - store 3-4 days in fridge
* To reheat: stir fry in skillet over medium heat, add splash of water to loosen sauce
