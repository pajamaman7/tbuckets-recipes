## steps  
1. In a large Dutch oven over medium high heat, fry the bacon until crispy, stirring it frequently. Drain on a paper towel lined plate, then set aside until needed.
2. Leave the bacon grease in the pan. Add the yellow onion, bell peppers, jalapeño peppers, and carrots and sauté until soft and almost caramelized, about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add in the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
3. Add the ground beef and brown, stirring gently, trying not to break up the beef too much (larger chunks are our goal). Cook until the meat is deeply browned and cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes.
4. Add all seasonings(sugar, taco seasoning, soy, coffee, salt and pepper to taste), and cook for about 1 minute.
5. Add the tomato paste and stir well to break it up into the meat. Cook for about 2 minutes, then add in the crushed tomatoes. Cook for another 2 minutes.
6. Stir in the cooked bacon, beans, and broth (and beer, if using) and mix well to combine. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. If the chili appears to be getting too thick, add a little more broth as needed.
7. Scoop into bowls and serve with garnishes: cilantro, cheddar, avocado, green onions, chips, jalapeno lime mayo (my fav), etc etc
