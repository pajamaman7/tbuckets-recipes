# Old-Fashioned Beef Stew
Simple, classic beef stew with tender meat and vegetables in a rich broth

## info  
* About 2.5 hours  
* 2 servings  

## ingredients
* 1/4 cup tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
* 1/2 pound beef stewing meat, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes
* 2 1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil
* 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
* 1/2 cup red wine
* 2 cups beef broth, homemade or low-sodium canned
* 1 bay leaf
* Salt to taste
* 1/2 medium onion, peeled and chopped
* 2-3 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch rounds
* 1 large baking potato, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch cubes

## steps  
1. Combine the flour and pepper in a bowl, add the beef and toss to coat well.
2. Heat about 1 1/2 teaspoons of the oil in a large pot. Add the beef a few pieces at a time; do not overcrowd. Cook, turning the pieces until beef is browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch; add more oil as needed between batches.
3. Remove the beef from the pot and add the vinegar and wine. Cook over medium-high heat, scraping the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits.
4. Add the beef and bay leaf. Add enough broth to cover the meat. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a slow simmer.
5. Cover and cook, skimming broth from time to time, until the beef is tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
6. Add the onions and carrots. Cover with more broth and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.
7. Add the potatoes, cover with water or broth (if you have any left), and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.
8. Add broth or water if the stew is dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
9. Remove bay leaf before serving. Ladle into 2 bowls and serve.

## notes  
* Brown meat in batches to avoid overcrowding - don't steam, sear
* Red wine vinegar deglazes pan and adds depth
* Even better the next day - flavors develop overnight
* Bay leaf is essential but remove before serving
* Skim foam from broth during cooking for clearer result
