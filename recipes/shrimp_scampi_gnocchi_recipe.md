# One-Pan Shrimp Scampi with Crispy Gnocchi
Quick and flavorful meal ready in just 25 minutes

## info  
* About 25 minutes  
* 3-4 servings  

## ingredients
* 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
* 1 pound gnocchi (fresh, frozen or shelf-stable)
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 4 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced
* 1/2 cup dry white wine (or clam juice, or broth)
* Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and freshly ground black pepper
* 1/8 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving
* 1 pound large or extra-large shrimp, shelled (deveined, if you like)
* 1 lemon
* 1/2 cup chopped parsley

## steps  
1. In a large, preferably nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high. Add gnocchi to the pan, breaking up any that are stuck together. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes, tossing every 1 to 2 minutes, so they get golden and crispy all over. Transfer to a bowl or plate.
2. In the same skillet over medium-high, add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and all of the butter, letting it melt for a few seconds. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
3. Add wine, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and all of the red-pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer, and let the wine reduce by half, about 2 minutes.
4. Add shrimp and sauté until they just start to turn pink, 2 to 3 minutes, depending on their size.
5. Return gnocchi to the pan and add another 1/4 teaspoon salt. Using a microplane or other fine grater, grate the zest from the lemon into the pan. Add parsley, tossing well. If your pan looks dry, add a splash of water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing to combine, then remove pan from the heat.
6. Cut the naked lemon in two and squeeze in the juice from one half, gently tossing to combine. Taste and add more salt if you like. Cut the remaining lemon half into wedges for serving.
7. Top with more olive oil and more red-pepper flakes, if you'd like, and serve with lemon wedges on the side.

## notes  
* Remove gnocchi from package and gently break apart before sautéing for easier cooking
* Use a microplane to finely grate garlic for best results
* Shelf-stable potato gnocchi works well - store brands like Wegman's hold up nicely
* Make sure gnocchi gets golden and crispy all over for best texture
* If pan looks dry during final tossing, add water 1 tablespoon at a time
* Pairs perfectly with good Italian bread to soak up the sauce
* The sauce has the right balance of spice and flavor
