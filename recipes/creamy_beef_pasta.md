## ingredients
### Main components
* 1 lb ground beef  
* 1 tbsp avocado oil  
* 1.5 tsp salt  
* 1 tsp black pepper  
* 2 tsp onion powder  
* 2 tsp garlic powder  
* 1 shallot, diced  
* 6 cloves garlic, minced  
* 1/3 cup white wine  
* 2 cups beef broth  
* 8 oz Ditalini pasta  

### Finish
* 1/2 cup heavy cream  
* 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan  
* 1/4 cup chopped parsley  

## steps  
1. Heat avocado oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add ground beef, salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned. Add a bit of Parmesan if desired, then remove beef from the pan and set aside.  
2. In the same pan, add diced shallot and minced garlic. Sauté until fragrant and softened.  
3. Pour in white wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits. Let it reduce slightly, then add beef broth.  
4. Add Ditalini pasta, ensuring it’s mostly submerged. Cover and cook for 8–10 minutes, or until the pasta is tender.  
5. Reduce heat to low, then stir in heavy cream and remaining Parmesan until smooth and creamy. Return the beef to the pan and toss to combine.  
6. Garnish with chopped parsley and extra Parmesan before serving.  

## notes  
* Substitute ground turkey or pork for the beef.  
* Add chili flakes for heat.  
* Try pecorino instead of Parmesan for a sharper flavor.
