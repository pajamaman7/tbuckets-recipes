* 1 medium red onion, peeled and diced
* 1/4 cup cilantro, minced plus more for garnish
* 1 poblano pepper, seeded and diced
* 1 roma tomato, cored and diced

## steps  
1. Dice the chicken into small pieces. Combine taco seasoning in a small bowl and set aside.

3. Add oil to a large skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add the chicken and cook until it starts to brown, 2 to 3 minutes.

* Perfect for meal prep - cook chicken, veggies, and rice ahead of time
* To meal prep: divide chicken and rice into containers, pack pico and toppings separately, refrigerate up to 4 days
* Homemade taco seasoning is less processed and you control the sodium
* Fresh pico de gallo can be made with chopped jalapeños for extra spice
