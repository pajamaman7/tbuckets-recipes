# Beef tacos

## info
* About 30minutes 
* 3-5 servings

## ingredients
* 2 lb ground beef
* 1-2 cans black, kidney, or refried beans
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 large onion, diced
* 1 pack (50g) of your favorite taco seasoning
* 1/2 tsp red chili flakes
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 1/4 cup salsa
* 100ml pilsner beer

## steps
* If not using refried beans, add butter and oil to a pot, and mash the (rinsed and drained) beans over medium heat. After about 5-7 mins, once the beans form a paste, remove and let sit in a bowl.
* Add more oil, and cook the onions, until translucent, around 5-7 minutes. Add garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
* Add beef and brown, adding spices, salsa, tomato sauce, and beer at your leisure. Cook until beef is almost entirely cooked, then add back the beans and stir until combined
* Serve in hard or soft taco shells, burritos, salad. Or any way you like, with lettuce, tomato, corn cheese, and more.

## notes
* Don't have fresh corn or prefer canned food that doesn't expire? Add canned corn to the taco meat in the final step of cooking!
* Chili flakes and beer are optional but great for flavor.
