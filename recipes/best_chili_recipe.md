# The Best Homemade Chili Recipe (Half Batch)
Hearty ground beef and bean chili with bacon - perfect comfort food for chilly nights

## info  
* About 2.5 hours (30 min prep + 2 hours simmer)  
* 3-4 servings  

## ingredients
* 4 ounces bacon, chopped
* 1/2 large yellow onion, diced
* 1/2 red bell pepper, seeds and core removed, diced
* 1/2 jalapeño pepper, diced
* 1 carrot, minced
* 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 pound lean ground beef
* 1 teaspoon light brown sugar
* 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 3-ounce can tomato paste (half of 6-ounce can)
* 1 14-ounce can crushed tomatoes with basil (half of 28-ounce can)
* 1 1/2 15-ounce cans of beans (use 1 kidney, 1/2 black, 1/2 pinto), drained and rinsed
* 1 1/2 cups beef broth (or 1 cup beef broth and 1/2 cup pilsner beer)

## steps  
1. In a large Dutch oven over medium high heat, fry the bacon until crispy, stirring it frequently. Drain on a paper towel lined plate, then set aside until needed.
2. Leave the bacon grease in the pan. Add the yellow onion, bell peppers, jalapeño peppers, and carrots and sauté until soft and almost caramelized, about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add in the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
3. Add the ground beef and brown, stirring gently, trying not to break up the beef too much (larger chunks are our goal). Cook until the meat is deeply browned and cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes.
4. Add the brown sugar, salt, pepper, and all spices and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
5. Add the tomato paste and stir well to break it up into the meat. Cook for about 2 minutes, then add in the crushed tomatoes. Cook for another 2 minutes.
6. Stir in the cooked bacon, beans, and broth (and beer, if using) and mix well to combine. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. If the chili appears to be getting too thick, add a little more broth as needed.
7. Scoop into bowls and serve with garnishes.

## notes  
* **Secret ingredient:** Bacon adds incredible smoky flavor - don't skip it!
* **Perfect bean to meat ratio** with red kidney, black, and pinto beans
* **Spice level:** Reduce cayenne and jalapeño for milder heat
* **Meat tips:** Use 90/10 lean ground beef for best flavor. Don't break up too much - want larger chunks
* **Vegetable substitutions:** Can omit carrots if not a veggie lover, use less peppers for medium heat
* **Liquid options:** Can use all beef broth or substitute beer for extra flavor
* **Texture:** Use crushed tomatoes instead of diced for smoother consistency
* **Simmering:** Tastes good after 1 hour but better after full 2 hours
* **Half batch notes:** You may have leftover canned tomatoes and beans - save for another use or make extra chili
* **Freezer friendly:** Keeps up to 2 months frozen - cool completely before freezing
* **Slow cooker option:** After reaching simmer, transfer to slow cooker or Instant Pot
* **Popular toppings:** Shredded cheddar, sour cream, cilantro, avocado, green onions, Fritos
