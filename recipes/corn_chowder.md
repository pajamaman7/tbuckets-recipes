## steps
1. (Optional) Cut kernels from corn, and place in a large bowl. Place cobs in a medium pot and add Parmesan rind (if using), thyme, bay leaf, Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton's kosher salt, and 8 cups water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until broth is fragrant and reduced by half, 40–50 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl; discard solids and set broth aside.
2.  Meanwhile, heat 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a large heavy soup pot or Dutch oven over medium-high. Add corn kernels, season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until corn is tender and juices have evaporated and browned on the bottom of the pot, 12–15 minutes. Reserve ½ cup corn for garnish; transfer remaining corn to a medium bowl.
3.  Add white wine to pot and cook, scraping up browned bits, until liquid is syrupy, about 2 minutes. Scrape into bowl with remaining corn.
4.  Melt remaining 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter in same pot over medium heat and cook bacon, until golden brown and fat has rendered, about 6 minutes.
5. Add potatoes, shallots, green onion, garlic cloves, finely grated, stirring occasionally, until vegetables have softened but haven't taken on any color, 12–15 minutes. 
6. Add chilies, Stir in flour and cook until nutty and fragrant, about 1 minute.
6. Add broth to cover, bring to a boil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are fork-tender, 10–15 minutes. 
7. Add cream and corn mixture and cook, stirring, until chowder has thickened, 5–10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in marjoram. Let sit 15 minutes before serving.
8. Divide chowder among bowls. Top with chopped parsley or chives, oyster crackers, and garnish; season with pepper.

## notes
*   Making the corn broth from the cobs adds incredible depth of flavor to the chowder. 
*   Parmesan rinds add umami richness to the broth. Save them when you finish a wedge of parmesan. Alternatively add a splash of soy sauce, reducing salt as necessary.
*   Fresh marjoram is preferred, but you can substitute fresh oregano or thyme if needed.
*   The chowder will thicken as it sits. Thin with additional broth or water when reheating if desired.
