# Korean Beef Rice Bowl
Easy and delicious Korean beef made with ground beef, served over rice with cucumbers and gochujang sauce

## info  
* About 20 minutes  
* 4 servings  

## ingredients
* 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons light brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
* cooking spray
* 1 pound 93% lean ground beef
* 1/4 cup chopped yellow onion
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger
* 3 cups cooked brown rice
* 1 small sliced cucumber, skin on
* 2 tablespoons Gochujang Sauce, or more if desired
* 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds
* 2 sliced scallions, white and green parts

## steps  
1. Combine the soy sauce, 2 tablespoons water, brown sugar, sesame oil and red pepper flakes in a small bowl.
2. Heat a large deep nonstick skillet over high heat, spray with oil and add the ground beef. Cook, breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon until cooked through, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the onion, garlic and ginger and cook 1 minute.
4. Pour the sauce over the beef, cover and simmer on low heat 10 minutes.
5. To assemble the bowls, place 3/4 cup rice in each bowl, top with scant 2/3 cup beef, cucumbers, Gochujang, sesame seeds and scallions.

## notes  
* Can swap beef for lean ground turkey, ground pork, ground chicken, or vegetarian options like crumbled tofu
* Try topping with a fried egg for extra protein
* Can add sautéed mushrooms, bok choy, matchstick carrots, or edamame
* Add pickled onions, cucumbers, carrots, or kimchi for extra flavor
* For more spice, garnish with sliced fresh jalapeños
* For fewer carbs, serve over cauliflower rice or veggie rice
* Can make lettuce wraps instead of bowls
* Gochujang is essential - sriracha mixed with hoisin sauce or sugar and sesame oil can substitute but won't be exact
* For mild version, omit red pepper from beef and serve gochujang on the side
* Store cooked beef up to 4 days in fridge or 3 months in freezer
* For meal prep, store beef/rice/sauce in one container, veggies in another
