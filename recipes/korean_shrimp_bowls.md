## steps  
1. **Make the Sauce:** Put the soy sauce, gochujang, honey, garlic, ginger, and lime juice in a bowl and whisk until combined. The gochujang is thick so it takes a minute to come together.
2. **Make Spicy Mayo:** Mix 1/2 cup of the Korean sauce with the mayo and set aside as a sauce for the rice bowls.
3. **Prepare Shrimp:** Peel and devein the shrimp and pat them dry. Toss the remaining sauce in a bowl with the shrimp.
4. **Cook Shrimp:** Cook the shrimp in an air fryer at 400 degrees for 8-10 minutes, or on a lined baking sheet in a 400 degree oven for 8-10 minutes.
5. **Cook Vegetables:** Set a skillet over medium heat. Add a small amount of vegetable oil and the shredded carrots and zucchini. Season with kosher salt and pepper. Cook 3-5 minutes, stirring a few times. (You can cook them together or separate depending on presentation preference.)
6. **Assemble Bowls:** Divide the rice between four bowls. Add the shrimp, carrots, zucchini, and avocado over top. Drizzle with the spicy mayo sauce and add optional toppings like sesame seeds, green onions, lime wedges, and pickled red onions if desired.

## notes  
* Gochujang chili paste can be found in the Asian section of grocery stores
* The sauce sticks better to dry shrimp, so pat them well before coating
* You can cook vegetables together or separately for different presentation styles
* Bowls are customizable - set out all toppings and let everyone make their own
* Great for meal prep - components can be stored separately
* The spicy gochujang mayo is key to bringing all the flavors together
* Can substitute shrimp with chicken, pork, or tofu
* Pickled vegetables add great tangy contrast to the rich flavors
* Mix everything together after admiring the presentation for best flavor distribution
