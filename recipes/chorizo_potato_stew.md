## steps
1.  Cook bacon in a large pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown but not yet crisp, 5–7 minutes. Transfer to paper towels.
2.  Add onion to the same pot and cook, stirring often, until golden and softened, 8–10 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until slightly darkened in color, about 2 minutes.
3.  Return bacon to the pot. Add potatoes, chorizo, mushrooms, broth, paprika, and cayenne. Bring to a boil.
4.  Reduce heat to maintain a bare simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, 25–30 minutes. Remove from heat and season with salt to taste.
5.  While the stew cooks, stir sour cream and 1 Tbsp. water in a small bowl to combine; season with a pinch of salt.
6.  Divide stew among bowls. Top with a dollop of the prepared sour cream, torn dill, and a few grinds of black pepper.

## notes
*   For a less spicy stew, use sweet smoked paprika instead of hot.
*   Yukon Gold potatoes can be used instead of russets and will hold their shape a little better.
*   The stew thickens as it sits. Add a splash of broth or water when reheating leftovers if desired.
