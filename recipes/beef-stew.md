# Classic Beef Stew
French-style beef stew with fork-tender meat in rich wine-based broth - perfect for batch cooking

## info  
* About 3.5 hours
* 6 servings  

## ingredients
* 3 pounds boneless beef chuck (well-marbled), cut into 1½-inch pieces
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 medium yellow onions, cut into 1-inch chunks
* 7 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
* 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
* 1½ tablespoons tomato paste
* ¼ cup all-purpose flour
* 2 cups dry red wine
* 2 cups beef broth
* 2 cups water
* 1 bay leaf
* ½ teaspoon dried thyme
* 1½ teaspoons sugar
* 4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks on a diagonal
* 1 pound small white boiling potatoes (baby yukons), cut in half
* Fresh chopped parsley, for serving (optional)

## steps  
1. Preheat the oven to 325°F and set a rack in the lower middle position.
2. Pat the beef dry and season with the salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. Brown the meat in 3 batches, turning with tongs, for about 5 minutes per batch; add one tablespoon more oil for each batch. (To sear properly, do not crowd the pan.) Transfer meat to a large plate.
3. Add the onions, garlic and balsamic vinegar; cook, stirring and scraping brown bits from bottom of pan, for about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook for a minute more.
4. Add beef with juices back to pan and sprinkle with flour. Stir with wooden spoon until flour is dissolved, 1-2 minutes. Add wine, beef broth, water, bay leaf, thyme, and sugar. Stir to loosen any brown bits and bring to a boil.
5. Cover pot with lid, transfer to preheated oven, and braise for 2 hours.
6. Remove pot from oven and add carrots and potatoes. Cover and place back in oven for about an hour more, or until vegetables are cooked, broth is thickened, and meat is tender.
7. Fish out bay leaf and discard, then taste and adjust seasoning. Serve warm, garnished with fresh parsley if desired.

## notes  
* **Perfect for batch cooking:** Makes 6 servings, even better when made 1-2 days ahead
* **Wine choice:** Use any dry red (Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet) that's good enough to drink
* **Stovetop option:** Can cook on lowest heat setting if no Dutch oven, stir occasionally
* **Slow cooker version:** Sear meat first, then transfer everything to crockpot, cook 4-5 hours
* **Thicker sauce option:** Mash 2 tbsp softened butter + 2 tbsp flour into paste, stir in small amounts
* **Storage:** Refrigerate up to 3 days, reheat on stovetop over medium-low
* **Serve with:** Crusty bread, popovers, egg noodles, mashed potatoes, or polenta
