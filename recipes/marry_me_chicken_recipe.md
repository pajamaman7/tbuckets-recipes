# Marry Me Chicken
Tender chicken breasts in a light, creamy sauce with sun-dried tomatoes and spinach

## info  
* About 30 minutes  
* 4 servings  

## ingredients
* 1/4 cup sundried tomatoes in oil, drained and chopped
* 2 8-ounce boneless skinless chicken breasts, halved lengthwise (1 lb total)
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1/4 cup all purpose flour (or gluten-free flour mix)
* 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, divided (can use oil from sundried tomatoes)
* 1 small shallot, minced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon tomato paste
* 4 cups baby spinach, packed
* 1 1/2 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese (3 tablespoons)
* 3/4 cup chicken broth
* 3 tablespoons half-and-half
* 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
* pinch red pepper flakes, adjust to taste
* 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

## steps  
1. Begin by pounding the halved chicken breasts to an even thickness (about 1/2-inch thick). Season them with salt and black pepper. Dredge each chicken piece in flour, shaking off any excess.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil (or use from the sun dried tomatoes) in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side or until the chicken is cooked through and has a golden-brown crust. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.
3. In the same skillet, add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the minced shallot and garlic and saut√© for about 1-2 minutes until they become fragrant and translucent.
4. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
5. Add the chopped sundried tomatoes and baby spinach to the skillet. Cook until the spinach wilts.
6. Reduce the heat to low, and then add the cream cheese, chicken broth, half-and-half, dried oregano, and red pepper flakes. Stir until the cream cheese is fully melted and the sauce is well combined.
7. Return the cooked chicken to the skillet and let it simmer in the sauce for a few minutes until heated through.
8. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese and serve.

## notes  
* Swap chicken breasts with chicken tenders or thighs
* For gluten-free, replace all-purpose flour with a gluten-free mix
* Substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth
* For spicier chicken, add more red pepper flakes or omit them for a milder version
* Many readers recommend doubling the sauce, especially when serving over pasta, rice, or mashed potatoes
* Don't like spinach? Try kale, mushrooms, or even chopped broccoli
* Popular pairings include orzo, angel hair pasta, mashed potatoes, cauliflower rice, or roasted veggies
* Store leftovers up to 4 days in fridge or 3 months in freezer
