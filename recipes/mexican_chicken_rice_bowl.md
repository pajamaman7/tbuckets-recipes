* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1 red bell pepper, diced or sliced
* 1 cup long grain rice, uncooked
* 1 cup chicken stock/broth, low sodium

## steps  
1. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan).
2. **Mexican spice mix:** Mix the spice ingredients in a small bowl.
3. **Rub Chicken:** Place 1 1/2 tablespoons of the Mexican Spice Mix in a large bowl (reserve rest for rice) with 1 tablespoon olive oil and lime juice. Mix to form a paste then add the chicken and toss to coat.
4. **Marinate (optional):** Marinate chicken for 1 hour if you have time. Otherwise, proceed with recipe!
5. **Sear chicken:** Using a large deep ovenproof skillet with a lid, heat the remaining 1 tbsp olive oil over medium high heat. Sear the skin side of the chicken for 4 minutes until light golden, then sear the flesh side for 1½ minutes (will still be raw inside). Remove onto a plate.
6. **Sauté aromatics:** If you've got a lot of burnt spices on the base, scrape off and discard some. In the same skillet over medium high heat, add the onion, garlic and bell pepper. Sauté for 3 minutes until the onion softens.
7. **Rice & liquid:** Add the rice and stir. Add chicken stock, tomato passata, corn, beans and remaining Mexican Spice Mix. Stir to combine.
8. **Top with chicken:** Place chicken on top of the rice, skin side up. It will be partially submerged but most of the skin should be above the liquid.
9. **Bake covered 25 min:** Bring to simmer, then cover skillet with a lid or foil and place in the oven for 25 minutes.
10. **Bake uncovered 15 min:** Remove the lid/foil and bake for a further 15 minutes until only small puddles of liquid remain on the surface of the rice.
11. **Rest 10 minutes:** Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes (uncovered). Any remaining liquid will evaporate in this step.
12. **Serve:** Squeeze the juice of 1 lime over the chicken and rice. Remove chicken or push to the side then fluff the rice. Serve, garnished with cilantro, extra lime wedges and sliced jalapeños, if desired.

## notes  
* **Boneless chicken:** If using boneless thighs, add them halfway through the covered bake time (after 12-13 minutes)
* **Chickpeas substitution:** Can use your chickpeas instead of black beans
* **Taco seasoning:** Can substitute the spice mix with 2-3 tablespoons of your taco seasoning
* **Rice type:** Long grain rice works best. Avoid jasmine, brown rice, or risotto rice
* **No ovenproof skillet?** Do stove steps in any pan then transfer to a baking dish, cover with foil
* **Complete meal:** Contains protein, starch, and vegetables - no sides needed
* **Hands-off cooking:** After searing, it's all done in the oven - no stirring or watching
* **Marinating:** Chicken tastes better marinated but not required - still delicious without
* **Storage:** Leftover rice keeps 2 days, cooked chicken keeps 3-4 days
* **Cooking vessel:** Use a 30cm/12" shallow casserole or large ovenproof skillet/pot
* **Can freeze:** Freezes well for meal prep
