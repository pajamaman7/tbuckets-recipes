## steps
1.  Put pork ribs into a pot. Add cold water about 1 inch over the meat. Bring it to a boil.
2.  Skim off any foam appearing on the surface until there is no more. Take out the ribs and discard the water.
3.  Put the ribs in the cleaned pot, then pour in 4 cups of hot water and add salt, the whole bulb of garlic, and peppercorns kept in a strainer or a spice bag.
4.  Bring the water to a full boil then turn the heat down to low. Cover the pot with a tight lid and leave to simmer for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the meat becomes tender.
5.  Take out the garlic and peppercorns. Add the sweetcorn pieces and carrot chunks. Increase the heat to medium. Leave to boil with the lid on for about 10 minutes until the carrot softens.
6.  Taste the soup to decide if extra salt is needed. Garnish with chopped scallions or cilantro before dishing out to serve.

## notes
*   The blanching procedure (known as Chāo Shuǐ/焯水 in Chinese) is essential as it removes any impurity of the pork and reduces its gamey taste. Do not skip it.
*   To prevent peppercorns from floating around, place them in a strainer/infuser or a small spice bag made of muslin cloth.
*   In Chinese cuisine, pork ribs are commonly cut into bite-sized pieces before cooking. If you don't have access to an Asian butcher, feel free to use regular-sized ribs. Pick pieces that have a good bone-to-meat ratio.
*   For vegetable substitutions, daikon (white radish), lotus roots, winter melon, and kelp (kombu) are popular choices. You may need to adjust cooking time accordingly.
*   **Instant Pot method:** Cook ribs for 15 minutes on high pressure, followed by natural release. Do steps 1 and 3 using the sauté function.
*   **Make ahead:** Blanch and cook the ribs as instructed. Store meat and soup in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days or in the freezer for 3 months. Defrost, then add vegetables and cook until carrots soften.
