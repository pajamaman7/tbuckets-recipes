# üë®‚Äçüç≥ Recipes

A list of personal recipes in markdown format and the source-code to render them
on a website.

Copied from https://github.com/Bastian/recipes, then modified to change markdown read style, and colorscheme to gruvbox :)

## Format

### Recipes

While recipes are 100% markdown, this does not mean, that every markdown
document is compatible. Recipes must follow a specific format that looks like
the one shown below:

```markdown
# Recipe Title

A description of the recipe (or even better an image).

## info  
* bullet list
* containing serving and time info

## ingredients
### Component 1
* takes 
* some
* ingredients

### Component 2
* takes
* more
* ingredients

## steps  
1. A guide
2. To the recipe

## notes  
* Common modifications
* Substitutions

## based on  
Some other Recipe - recipe.com
```

The titles for ingredients and the instructions are not fixed and can be for
example in your local language. Only the order matters.

There must be exactly one `h1` header and two to three `h2` headers. If the
markdown does not fullfil these requirements, the script might not render the
recipe correctly or maybe even not at all.

### Recipe list

The recipe list is rendered from the `recipes.md` file and can be in any format
you want. The website just renders the markdown without any special treatment.
